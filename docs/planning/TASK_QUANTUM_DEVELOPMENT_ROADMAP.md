# TASK: Quantum Development Roadmap
**ID**: QDR-20250119-01  
**Date**: 2025-01-19  
**Strategic Alignment**: Real quantum computing integration with D-Wave Ocean SDK

## Scope
Develop production-ready quantum applications using authentic D-Wave Ocean SDK, following official workflows and best practices. Build upon our real `dwave_quantum_connector.py` integration.

## Strategic Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Authentication ✅
- [x] Real D-Wave Ocean SDK integration created
- [x] Legitimate connector without fake implementations  
- [x] Requirements.txt updated with `dwave-ocean-sdk>=7.0.0`
- [ ] **Next**: Set up D-Wave Leap account authentication
- [ ] Configure virtual environment with Ocean CLI
- [ ] Validate real QPU access with `dwave ping`

### Phase 2: Quantum Application Development
Following D-Wave's official workflow: **Formulation → Sampling → Solutions**

#### 2A: Problem Formulation
Create real quantum applications using supported models:
- [ ] **Binary Quadratic Models (BQM)** - For binary decision problems
- [ ] **QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)** - For optimization
- [ ] **Ising Models** - For spin glass problems  
- [ ] **Constrained Quadratic Models (CQM)** - For hybrid solving

#### 2B: Sampler Integration
- [ ] **Quantum Samplers**: Real D-Wave Advantage system access
- [ ] **Hybrid Samplers**: LeapHybridCQMSampler for large problems
- [ ] **Classical Samplers**: ExactSolver for testing/validation

#### 2C: Production Applications
- [ ] **Optimization Problems**: Portfolio optimization, supply chain
- [ ] **Machine Learning**: Quantum ML model training
- [ ] **Graph Problems**: Maximum cut, graph coloring
- [ ] **Sampling**: Quantum sampling for probabilistic models

### Phase 3: MCP Integration
Integrate quantum capabilities with our MCP-first architecture:
- [ ] Create MCP quantum tools using real D-Wave results
- [ ] Quantum-classical hybrid workflows via MCP
- [ ] A2A quantum agent coordination
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization

## Technical Implementation

### Required D-Wave Setup
```bash
# 1. Virtual Environment
python -m venv ocean_env
source ocean_env/bin/activate  # Unix/Mac
# ocean_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# 2. Install Ocean SDK  
pip install dwave-ocean-sdk

# 3. Setup & Authentication
dwave setup --auth
# Follow OAuth flow to authorize Leap access

# 4. Verify Connection
dwave ping --client qpu
dwave solvers --list --all
```

### Quantum Application Examples

#### Example 1: Portfolio Optimization (CQM)
```python
from dimod import ConstrainedQuadraticModel, Binary
from dwave.system import LeapHybridCQMSampler

# Real financial optimization problem
def create_portfolio_cqm(returns, risks, budget):
    cqm = ConstrainedQuadraticModel()
    
    # Binary variables for asset selection
    assets = [Binary(f'asset_{i}') for i in range(len(returns))]
    
    # Maximize returns (minimize negative returns)
    objective = -sum(returns[i] * assets[i] for i in range(len(returns)))
    
    # Add risk penalty  
    for i in range(len(risks)):
        for j in range(len(risks)):
            objective += risks[i][j] * assets[i] * assets[j]
    
    cqm.set_objective(objective)
    
    # Budget constraint
    cqm.add_constraint(sum(assets) <= budget, "budget_limit")
    
    return cqm, assets

# Solve with real D-Wave hybrid solver
sampler = LeapHybridCQMSampler()
sampleset = sampler.sample_cqm(cqm, label="Portfolio-Optimization")
```

#### Example 2: Graph Coloring (BQM)
```python
from dwave_networkx import graph_coloring
from dwave.system import DWaveSampler, EmbeddingComposite
import networkx as nx

# Real map coloring problem
def solve_graph_coloring(graph, num_colors):
    # Create BQM for graph coloring
    bqm = graph_coloring(graph, num_colors)
    
    # Use real D-Wave QPU with embedding
    sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())
    
    # Solve on actual quantum hardware
    sampleset = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads=1000, label="Graph-Coloring")
    
    return sampleset
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical Validation

- [ ] **Problem Solving**: BQM/CQM problems solved with legitimate quantum results
- [ ] **Performance**: Quantum speedup demonstrated vs classical methods
- [ ] **Integration**: MCP-quantum workflows functioning end-to-end

### Business Impact  
- [ ] **Use Cases**: 3+ real quantum applications deployed
- [ ] **Optimization**: Measurable improvement in problem-solving efficiency
- [ ] **Scalability**: Hybrid quantum-classical workflows handling large problems
- [ ] **Innovation**: Novel quantum-MCP-A2A architectural patterns

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

# Verify Ocean SDK installation
python -c "import dwave.ocean; print('Ocean SDK ready')"

# Test real D-Wave connection  
dwave ping --client qpu
