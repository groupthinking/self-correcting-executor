## Implementation Summary âœ… COMPLETED

### What Was Implemented
1. **Proper MCP Server**: Replaced the custom FastAPI implementation with a proper MCP server that follows the official MCP protocol specification
2. **JSON-RPC Compliance**: Full compliance with JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol for all communication
3. **Tool Implementation**: Three fully functional tools:
   - `code_analyzer`: AST-based code analysis with complexity metrics
   - `protocol_validator`: MCP protocol compliance validation
   - `self_corrector`: Code issue detection and correction suggestions
4. **Resource Management**: Proper resource listing and reading capabilities
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper JSON-RPC error responses

### Technical Achievements
- **Protocol Version**: 2024-11-05 (latest MCP specification)
- **Communication**: stdin/stdout JSON-RPC communication
- **Tools**: 3 production-ready tools with proper schemas
- **Resources**: 2 informational resources (protocol spec, tools list)
- **Testing**: 100% test pass rate with comprehensive validation
