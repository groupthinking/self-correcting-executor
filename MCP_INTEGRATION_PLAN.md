# MCP Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan for integrating real MCP (Model Context Protocol) components across the system, ensuring no mock implementations are used in production.

## Real MCP Components

### Server Implementation

The RealMCPServer class provides:
- Tool execution framework
- Context management
- Agent communication
- No mock fallbacks

### Quantum Integration

Our quantum computing integration:
- Uses real D-Wave QPU hardware
- No simulation fallbacks
- Production-ready for optimization problems

### Agent Framework

All agents use real MCP for communication:
- MCPEnabledA2AAgent for agent-to-agent communication
- Real context sharing
- No mock behaviors

## Integration Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** (Complete)
   - Real MCP server implementation
   - Basic agent communication

2. **Phase 2: Quantum Integration** (In Progress)
   - D-Wave connector
   - Quantum optimization tools
   - Real QPU access

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Planned)
   - Multi-agent negotiation
   - Distributed computing
   - Performance optimization

## No-Mock Policy

Our strict no-mock policy ensures:
- All endpoints connect to real services
- No simulated data or responses
- No placeholder implementations
- Comprehensive testing with real components

## Conclusion

This integration plan ensures all MCP components are real, production-ready implementations with no mock or simulated behaviors.
