# Update Execution Summary

## Overview
Successfully executed all update items and pushed changes to GitHub branch: `cursor/analyze-project-for-errors-and-improvements-5bdd`

## What Was Executed

### 1. Development Environment Setup ✅
- Created and tested `scripts/quick-dev-setup.sh` 
- Successfully sets up minimal development environment
- Creates `.env` file with SQLite and in-memory cache
- No need for PostgreSQL or Redis installation
- Creates required directories: `data/`, `cache/`, `logs/`

### 2. MCP Server Fixed ✅
- Fixed import issues - now uses `FastMCP` from `mcp.server.fastmcp`
- Converted from low-level Server API to high-level FastMCP decorators
- Server starts successfully with warnings about optional env vars
- All 4 tools registered and working:
  - `quantum_optimize` - D-Wave quantum optimization
  - `process_data` - Real data processing
  - `execute_code` - Sandboxed Python execution  
  - `database_query` - SQLite database queries

### 3. Dependencies Installed ✅
- Installed `mcp` package (1.10.1) with all dependencies
- Installed `numpy` (2.3.1) for quantum connector
- PyYAML already available from system

### 4. Testing Completed ✅
- MCP compliance check passes (0 mock implementations)
- Created and ran `test_mcp_server.py` - all tools work correctly
- Server can process real data, execute code, and query databases
- Development setup test (`test_mcp_setup.py`) verifies environment

### 5. Git Operations ✅
- All changes committed with descriptive message
- Successfully pushed to GitHub repository
- Branch: `cursor/analyze-project-for-errors-and-improvements-5bdd`

## Current Status

### Working Components
- ✅ Quick development setup script
- ✅ MCP server with FastMCP
- ✅ All 4 MCP tools functional
- ✅ SQLite database support
- ✅ Sandboxed code execution
- ✅ Data processing capabilities

### Optional Components (Not Required for Basic Operation)
- ⚠️ D-Wave API token (get free at https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/)
- ⚠️ PostgreSQL support (SQLite works fine for development)
- ⚠️ Redis cache (in-memory cache works for development)

## How to Use

1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/groupthinking/self-correcting-executor
   cd self-correcting-executor
   chmod +x scripts/quick-dev-setup.sh
   ./scripts/quick-dev-setup.sh
   ```

2. **Load environment:**
   ```bash
   source .env
   ```

3. **Start MCP server:**
   ```bash
   python3 mcp_server/real_mcp_server.py
   ```

4. **Configure in Cursor:**
   Add to Cursor's MCP settings:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "real-mcp-server": {
         "command": "python3",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp_server/real_mcp_server.py"],
         "env": {
           "DATABASE_URL": "sqlite:///./mcp_local.db",
           "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Get D-Wave API Token** (optional):
   - Sign up at https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/
   - Add to `.env`: `DWAVE_API_TOKEN=your-token`

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Set up PostgreSQL for production database
   - Set up Redis for production caching
   - Configure proper authentication tokens
   - Enable all security features

3. **Extend Functionality**:
   - Add more MCP tools as needed
   - Implement additional data processors
   - Add support for more programming languages

## Verification

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# Check setup
python3 test_mcp_setup.py

# Test MCP compliance  
PYTHONPATH=/workspace python3 scripts/check-mcp-compliance.py

# Start server (will run forever, Ctrl+C to stop)
PYTHONPATH=/workspace python3 mcp_server/real_mcp_server.py
```

All components are now executing properly with no mock implementations remaining!
